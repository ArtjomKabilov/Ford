    <h1>Ford Edsel</h1>
    <p>
        Ford spent a long time conducting research into what the consumer wanted from a car. 
        But by the time Ford was ready to release the Edsel, the market had already moved on to compact cars and the Edsel was a flop.
        While market research can be powerful, it is only useful if it is also timely. 
        Being quick to market with fresh new ideas is essential or you run the risk of being left behind. 
        This is all the more relevant today when public opinion and trends are moving at breakneck speed.

    <h2>Why the project was faild?</h2>
    <li>The car has been in production for so long that interests have changed on the market.</li>
    <li>The design is interesting, but the car is outdated.</li>
    
    <h2>How we can prevent to this happend? </h2>    
    <li>If Ford followed the market changes, he would make a better car that many would buy. </li>
